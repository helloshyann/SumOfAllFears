# Sum Of All Fears

The Sum Of All Fears coding challenge is intended to assess a candidate’s ability to work with arrays. This challenge or a slight variation has been used by technology companies such as Amazon and Google and was also featured as a Daily Coding Problem in dev.to.

## Installation

This program has been modified to allow the user to enter in their own values for both the array and variable K before running the algorithm and returning which two numbers from the array add up to equal K.
